# Hi, Iâ€™m @HasnainShafiq.

I am a Psychology graduate pursuing a career in web development.

I am refining my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by developing projects for my portfolio. I aim to become familiar with the MERN stack before exploring other frameworks and tech stacks. I have some experience with MongoDB, Express, and NodeJS and I am currently learning React. I understand that different tasks require suitable tech-stacks, so it is my aim to become grounded in the principles of web-development and problem solving, so that I can adopt appropriate tech-stacks where required. At the moment, I am solely focused on becoming comfortable and experienced in the MERN stack, after which I intend on expanding my skill set. 

I have a personal blog (WIP) where I document my progress which you can check out [here](https://www.hasnainshafiq.com).
