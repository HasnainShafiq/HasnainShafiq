# Hi, Iâ€™m @HasnainShafiq.

I am a Psychology graduate/junior frontend developer.

I graduated with a First-Class honours degree in Pyschology with Counselling and Psychotherapy. Since then, I have continued to develop my skills as a developer. In particular, I make use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I prefer to use TailwindCSS for styling but I'm also comfortable with vanilla CSS. Likewise, I have experience in both React and Vue, but I am comfortable with vanilla JS too. I understand that programming is more than being well-versed with frameworks and languages. I am always trying to hone my approach to problem solving and thinking logically so that I can increase my efficacy and performance as a developer.

I worked as a junior frontend developer for a short while at the start of 2023 and I'm now looking for my next opportunity. 

I have a personal blog where I document my progress which you can check out [here](https://www.hasnainshafiq.com).
