Hi, I’m @Uncreative-creativity.

I’m interested in the front-end of web development. I am a uni student studying Psychology, but I'm learning web development on the side. 

I'm currently learning the three main languages of front-end development: html, css, and javascript. I can create very basic (and not very aesthetically pleasing) websites, but I am
constantly tying to improve and become more efficient at coding. In particular, I'm trying to work on making original, accesible, and well-designed pages. 

Any tips or suggestions are always welcome.
