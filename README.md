# Hi, Iâ€™m @Uncreative-creativity.

I am a Psychology graduate pursuing a career in web development.

I am refining my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by developing projects for my portfolio. I am aiming to become familiar with the MERN stack before exploring other frameworks and tech stacks. Currently, I have some experience with MongoDB, Express, and NodeJS. I have yet to start learning React.

I have a personal blog (WIP) where I document my progress which you can check out [here](hasnainshafiq.com).
